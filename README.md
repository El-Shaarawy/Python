Wikipedia Crawler in Python
There is a common belief that if you keep navigating to the first link on any page on wikipedia, you will end up in the 'Philosophy' page as it's the mother of all topics. This program goes automates this process. It goes through any chosen Wikipedia page to extract, keep track and navigate to the first link on each page and see where it leads. 

# Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.
In this project, I used Python to perform steps of the data analysis process on bikeshare trip data collected from three US cities. I wrote code to clean the data, compute descriptive statistics, and create basic visualizations of the distribution of data.
